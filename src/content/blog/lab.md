[Tharunika](https://in.linkedin.com/in/tharunika-g-b44329255) and I are going to start our **6th** semester in the coming days, so we thought it would be a good idea to explore a blog post where we would look back at our experience in biology and our personal learnings from it.

*This blog would be in a **FAQ** format*

So, **Lets Go!**

## Why Biology?

- To any newcomers, biology generally would seem like a subject that is quite remote to the purpose of learning - application.
- It's a theoretical science that finds application to humans in weird ways - similar to mathematics and physics. But its progress is not bounded by mathematics or calculations, it relies upon the logic of utilizing intelligence and knowledge of living stuff to push development of humanity.
- Hence, similarly, we too, were attracted by this principle since we both are quite good at logical reasoning and problem-solving. We majorly focus upon ~~engineering biology~~ biotechnology at University where calculations get involved a lot. 
- Yet, we get motivated to continue learning it to **fascinate** much upon the wonders of micro/macroscopic living beings.

> But, where is the application?
> -You

Well, it's a slightly longer process in our case:

Fascination 👉 Curiosity 👉 Questions 👉 Answers 👉 Application

- Results are often not guarantied and takes much effort to implement. Yet biology plays a very major role in our modern day-to-day life. 
- From bioinspired engineering solutions to vaccination, microbial products to food production, fixing climate change to synthetic evolution, we quite underestimate the impact of it in shaping our present world.
- Hence, choosing biology, or any derivative of it, professionally would be a great choice if you are genuinely attracted to it. Many other useful traits mentioned in ___ would help you out a lot too.

So basically, **#welikebio**

## How was your Academic Experience regarding this subject?

As we mentioned before, at University, we include both theory and calculations into our learning since it's an engineering course. But, somehow, we also observe that it also induces a systemic change to our approach to problem-solving, which we can apply to biology. And we are also provided the opportunity to lab experimentation and peer guidance. So, apart from the sleepless nights and stress of our exams, it's pretty cool 👍

## What were some of your memorable experiences in this subject?

We had been self-learning a bit about drug design and, coincidentally, we both join a hackathon hosted in our University for improved drug design to treat tuberculosis. And ~~**WON**~~ got third place 🎉. It was our first experience of applying our knowledge to solve a real world problem. With a grand prize of ......... 🥁🥁🥁........ *a yellow bucket*.

## How to approach and learn biology?

We sure would provide some tips and tricks to get into it:

- To learn the tags by which cell components, processes are recognized, rather than memorize names, if that makes sense 👍.
- To constantly link concepts into a giant mind map 🕸️
- Quality > Quantity of information.
- Sharp, clear mind to digest loads of information
- Recognize patterns in the working of lifeforms.
- Visualize **as much as possible**

## How would you describe yourself in a single sentence?

## How do I make a career out of it?

Well ..........

## How do I apply this to my day-to-day life?

You sure can. Every process of a living organism is the next step to optimizing whatever work we do. Carefully observe, learn and apply more of the intricacies of the surrounding nature, probably you can turn into Spider-Man too.✨

## Are you done?

Yes! Thanks for reading.
Time to divide and conquer like a cell in mitosis. Stay curious and keep exploring the wonders of life!
Bye👋
