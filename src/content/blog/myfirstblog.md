HiðŸ‘‹

First of all, welcome to my blog. I'm going to try to write blogs on this website since:

> Writing blogs â€¦ is cool I guessâ€¦
>-Shakespeare, 1582 AD

I do not have any particular aim and direction to lead this blog but I guess it will follow these themes:

* Majorly regarding my academic interests and the BTS of academic stuff I do
* Sometimes regarding my opinions as a student upon current affairs and academia
* Sometimes regarding personal and overall development, psychology
* A pinch of weird stuff

Apart from the above interests, I also sometimes spend time in journalling, travel, drawing. Here is one I made:
